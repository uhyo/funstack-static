# Release FUNSTACK Skill

To release a new version of the `@funstack/static` package, follow these steps:

1. Read the `packages/static/package.json` file to determine the current version of the package.

- User may or may not have already updated the version in `package.json`. Ask the user to confirm if they have updated the version. If not, you should update the version based on semantic versioning rules (patch, minor, major) as per user's instruction.

2. Update the version in `packages/static/package.json`, commit and push if necessary.

- The commit message should be `chore: bump version to x.y.z` where `x.y.z` is the new version.

3. Inspect the git log since the last release tag to generate release notes.

- The release notes should summarize the changes made since the last release.
- Especially, highlight any breaking changes, new features, or important fixes.

4. Use the `gh` CLI to create a new release on GitHub with the new version and the generated release notes.

- The tag name should be `x.y.z` where `x.y.z` is the new version.

5. Inform the user that the release has been created successfully, providing the URL to the release page on GitHub.
