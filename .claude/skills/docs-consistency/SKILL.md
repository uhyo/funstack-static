# Docs Consistency Skill

Documentation files (packages/docs) should be consistent and up-to-date with the codebase. When you make changes to the codebase that affect documented features, or when you update documentation files, ensure that all relevant documentation files reflect the changes accurately.

## Checklist

- [ ] New feature documentation is added. (when a new feature is introduced)
- [ ] Updated feature documentation reflects code changes. (when existing features are modified)
- [ ] Index pages don't lack links to new or updated sections.
