# Getting Started

Welcome to **FUNSTACK Static**! Build high-performance Single Page Applications powered by React Server Components - no server required at runtime.

## Installation

Install `@funstack/static` and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @funstack/static react react-dom
```

Or with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @funstack/static react react-dom
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Vite

Create or update your `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { funstackStatic } from "@funstack/static";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    funstackStatic({
      root: "./src/Root.tsx",
      app: "./src/App.tsx",
    }),
    react(),
  ],
});
```

### 2. Create Your Root Component

The Root component wraps your entire application and defines the HTML structure.

```tsx
// src/Root.tsx
import type React from "react";

export default function Root({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>My App</title>
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

The Root component:

- is responsible for defining the shell HTML structure of your app
- is a server component
- **CANNOT** import client components; you could, but they are fully rendered into static HTML and never hydrated

### 3. Create Your App Component

The App component defines what comes into the `children` of the Root. This is the entrypoint of your SPA.

Since the App component is a server component, for interactivity you can import and use client components inside it.

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import Counter from "./Counter";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
      <Counter />
    </main>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// src/Counter.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

The App component:

- is a server component
- **CAN** import client components and use them within the app

### 4. Add Routing (Optional)

If you want routing, you can bring your favorite SPA router. Here, we use `@funstack/router` as an example:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { Router } from "@funstack/router";
import { route } from "@funstack/router/server";

const routes = [
  route({
    path: "/",
    component: <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>,
  }),
  route({
    path: "/about",
    component: <h1>About Us</h1>,
  }),
];

export default function App() {
  return <Router routes={routes} />;
}
```

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:5173`!

### 6. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Your SPA is pre-rendered to static files in the `dist/public` directory, ready to deploy to any static hosting provider.

Since FUNSTACK Static is built on top of Vite, any Vite configurations and plugins should work seamlessly.

## Project Structure

A typical FUNSTACK Static project looks like this:

```
my-site/
├── src/
│   ├── ...
│   ├── Root.tsx        # HTML wrapper component
│   └── App.tsx         # Routes and main app
├── public/             # Static assets
├── vite.config.ts      # Vite configuration
└── package.json
```

Only two files are required: `Root.tsx` and `App.tsx`. The paths to these files can be customized in the `funstackStatic()` configuration.

## AI-Assisted Development (Optional)

If you use AI coding assistants like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), you can install the FUNSTACK Static knowledge skill to help your AI assistant better understand the framework:

```bash
npx funstack-static-skill-installer
# or, if you use skills CLI (https://skills.sh/)
npx skills add uhyo/funstack-static
```

This registers the `funstack-static-knowledge` skill, which provides your AI assistant with API references, best practices, and architectural guidance for FUNSTACK Static.
